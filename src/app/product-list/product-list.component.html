<!-- *ngFor is a "structural directive". Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the elements to which they are attached. Any directive with an * is a structural directive. -->
<!-- This div repeats itself for each element in 'products' -->

<div *ngFor="let product of products">


    <!-- the interpolation syntax {{ }}. Interpolation renders a property's value as text.-->


<!-- Add the anchor now, and set the anchor's title to be the product's name by using the property binding [ ] syntax, as shown below -->
<!--In the preview pane, hover over the displayed product name to see the bound name property value. They are the same. Interpolation {{ }} lets you render the property value as text; property binding [ ] lets you use the property value in a template expression.-->
<a [title]="product.name + ' details'">
    <h3>
        {{ product.name }}
    </h3>
    </a>

    <!-- This is *ngIf, not *ngFor, this is an if statement.  No description div is displayed for the last phone because it's description field is empty-->
    <p *ngIf="product.description">
        Description: {{ product.description }}
      </p>

      <!-- Event binding is done by using ( ) around the event, as shown below.

      </button>

      <!-- The new product alert component takes a product as input from the product list. With that input,
        it shows or hides the "Notify Me" button, based on the price of the product. The Phone XL price is
        over $700, so the "Notify Me" button appears on that product.  "product" is where the data is "gotten"
        and [product] is where it's sent to the product-alerts component and the logic is performed there.
